## Capstone project on rocket landings

As part of the group of courses that comprise the IBM Data Science Certificate through Coursera, I completed a capstone project that analyzes SpaceX launch data. 
The purpose of this project was to investigate variables that may affect launch outcomes, and build a classification model that predicts whether the first-stage boosters will successfully land. 

The Jupyter notebooks demonstrate the completed work and the final presentation is contained in the pdf. 

This project demonstrates ability with python, SQL, pandas, exploratory data visualization, creating, optimizing, and evaluating classification models, dashboard creation, and presentation ability.
